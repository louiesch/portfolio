    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi there! My name is <strong>Louie</strong>. I recently moved to Seattle, Washington after completing my BA in Philosophy at Oklahoma State University. For a while now I had become more interested in pursing further education, but was unsure if I should go to graduate school or try a work training program. After doing some research, I found Epicodus and decided to enroll.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Going fishing üé£</li>
        <li>Playing video games üéÆ</li>
        <li>Trying out new food üçî</li>
      </ol>
