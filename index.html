      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I recently moved to Seattle, Washington after completing my BA in Philosophy at Oklahoma State University. Due to COVID, I took a job at Jiffy Lube while I continued to job hunt. After a while I became more interested in pursing further education, but was unsure if I should go to graduate school or try a work training program. That is what led me to Epicodus, and after doing some research I decided to enroll in the C#/React track. <br> When I'm not coding, I enjoy going fishing 🎣, playing video games 🎮, and trying out new food 🍔!</p>
