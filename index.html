      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I recently moved to Seattle, Washington after completing my BA in Philosophy at Oklahoma State University. Due to COVID, I took a job at Jiffy Lube while I continued to job hunt. After a while I became more interested in pursing further education, but was unsure if I should go to graduate school or try a work training program. That is what led me to Epicodus, and after doing some research I decided to enroll in the C#/React track.

      When I'm not coding, I enjoy:
      <ol>
        <li>Going fishing üé£</li>
        <li>Playing video games üéÆ</li>
        <li>Trying out new food üçî</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <p>These are various sample pages I have created in order to practice the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.</p>
